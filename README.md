A small tool to show local FileTree repositories in GTSpotter, as a way to add them into repositories list.

This is  very useful when you work in several images at the same time, with crossed project. For example, I 
use [Voyage](http://github.com/estebanlm/voyage) all the time in several projects and is frequent that I need 
to fix a bug or add a feature, then I use a centralised local repository... and with this tool is very easy to 
add those local repositories.
